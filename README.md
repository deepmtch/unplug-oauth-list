# Quick Disconnect - Connected Apps URLs

This repository contains direct links to the "Connected Apps" or "Third-Party App Access" pages for popular online services. These links provide quick access to manage and disconnect apps that have access to your account, helping you maintain your privacy and security.

## Why This is Useful

Over time, many services grant access to third-party applications, whether it's for managing emails, calendars, or accessing personal data. Sometimes, you may want to quickly review or disconnect any applications you no longer trust or use. This list of URLs allows you to do that in one click, instead of navigating through multiple menus.

## How to Use

1. **Click the link** for the service you're interested in.
2. **Log in** if necessary.
3. **Review the apps** that have access to your account.
4. **Disconnect** any app that you no longer use or trust.
